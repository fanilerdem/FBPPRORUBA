Flow-Based Programming (FBP) Paradigm:

Summary:
Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm used in software development. This approach defines applications through data 
flows between components. Each component performs a specific task, and the data flows between these components form the overall logic of
 the application. FBP offers advantages such as modularity, understandability, reusability and testability.

Key Information:

Components (Nodes/Components): The application consists of components that perform specific tasks.
Edges/Connections: These are the connections that enable data flow between components.
Data Flows: Represents the movement of data between components.
Control Flows: Used to control the operating order of components.
Modularity: A modular structure is obtained by dividing the application into parts.
Understandability: Data flows clearly express the logic of the application and generally produce more understandable code.
Reusability: Components can be reused in different projects, which can speed up the development process.
Testability: It is easier to test each component individually.
Application Areas: It can be used in various application areas such as data analysis, microservice architectures, automation, network management.
